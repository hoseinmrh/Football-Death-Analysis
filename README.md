Football is the most popular sport in the world, but even football had its dark sides! Sometimes the stress and tension can cause death even during the match. <br/>

In this project we take a look at football's death based on a dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) <br/>

## Features
- All of the analyis is in notebook
- Clean code

## Project Structure
The project follows a specific structure to organize its files and directories:
```
diabetes-prediction-app/
├── Football Death.ipynb
├── README.md
├── football_deaths.csv
```
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.
